# Introduction to Number Theory

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of number theory
- Identify different types of numbers and their properties
- Apply basic operations to integers and rational numbers
- Recognize patterns in numerical sequences

## What is Number Theory?

Number theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers. It's one of the oldest and most fundamental areas of mathematics.

### Types of Numbers

#### Natural Numbers
The set of natural numbers (ℕ) includes all positive whole numbers:
- ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
- Used for counting and ordering

#### Whole Numbers
Whole numbers include zero and all natural numbers:
- W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}

#### Integers
Integers (ℤ) include all whole numbers and their negatives:
- ℤ = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

#### Rational Numbers
Rational numbers (ℚ) can be expressed as fractions where the numerator and denominator are integers:
- ℚ = {a/b | a, b ∈ ℤ, b ≠ 0}
- Examples: 1/2, -3/4, 7 (can be written as 7/1)

#### Irrational Numbers
Numbers that cannot be expressed as simple fractions:
- Examples: π, √2, e
- Have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal expansions

## Fundamental Properties

### Commutative Property
- **Addition**: a + b = b + a
- **Multiplication**: a × b = b × a

### Associative Property
- **Addition**: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- **Multiplication**: (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)

### Distributive Property
- a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)

### Identity Properties
- **Additive Identity**: a + 0 = a
- **Multiplicative Identity**: a × 1 = a

### Inverse Properties
- **Additive Inverse**: a + (-a) = 0
- **Multiplicative Inverse**: a × (1/a) = 1 (for a ≠ 0)

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Classifying Numbers
Identify whether each of the following is rational or irrational:
- 7/3 → Rational (can be expressed as a fraction)
- √9 → Rational (equals 3)
- √2 → Irrational (cannot be expressed as a fraction)
- 0.25 → Rational (equals 1/4)

### Example 2: Applying Properties
Use the distributive property to simplify: 3 × (4 + 5)
- 3 × (4 + 5) = (3 × 4) + (3 × 5) = 12 + 15 = 27

## Key Takeaways

1. Number theory studies the properties and relationships of numbers
2. Numbers can be classified into different types based on their properties
3. Fundamental properties govern how numbers interact in mathematical operations
4. Understanding these basics is essential for advanced mathematical concepts
